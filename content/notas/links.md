## üç™ Cocina

- [King Arthur Baking](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/)
- [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/) eats is solid, although the new site leaves something to be desired.
- [America's Test Kitchen](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/) is another good all-around choice, as is [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/) and [Food52](https://food52.com/)
- [No Recipes](https://norecipes.com/) is great for Japanese food
- [The Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/) for Chinese-American and Cantonese food, also [Marion's Kitchen](https://www.marionskitchen.com/) for a more pan-east-Asian approach.
- [Maangchi](https://www.maangchi.com/) for Korean
- [BBC Food](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes) has a solid and diverse recipe collection
- [Brian Lagerstrom](https://www.brianlagerstrom.com/) \- an American chef with a new-ish YouTube channel.
- [Akis Petretzikis](https://akispetretzikis.com/) for Greek
- [Rick Bayless](https://www.rickbayless.com/) for Mexican
- [Hot Thai Kitchen](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/) for Thai
- [Helen Rennie](https://youtube.com/c/helenrennie) - Excellent for Russian / Eastern European and also general western style food. Her poached egg method is the best way I've found to poach a lot of eggs at once.
- [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://youtube.com/c/ChineseCookingDemystified), for more of a deep dive into Chinese cuisine. Generally very good content, although for some reason I find their take on HK cuisine to be a bit off.
- [Chef Wang Gang](https://youtube.com/channel/UCg0m_Ah8P_MQbnn77-vYnYw) - another deep dive into Chinese cuisine. His egg fried rice (and fried rice tips in general) are worth checking out at least.
- [Food Wishes / Chef John](https://youtube.com/c/foodwishes) - Very popular, solid technical instruction and great for explaining how to be a better home chef. For whatever reason his recipes aren't usually how I cook, so I don't make his stuff. He's obviously skilled and an excellent teacher though.
- [Middle Eats](https://youtube.com/c/MiddleEats) - A small channel that does a great job of showing homestyle ME cooking. Watch the hummus video at least.
- [Recipe30](https://youtube.com/c/Recipe30) - Australian. Beautiful cinematography. Great classic recipes and simplified versions of them.
- [Made with Lau](https://youtube.com/c/MadeWithLau) - More great Chinese-American and Guangzhou cuisine.
- [Chef John Kung](https://youtube.com/c/ChefJonKung) - Hip, modern, good. Interesting 3rd culture fusion take on a lot of things.
- [Sip & Feast](https://youtube.com/c/SipandFeast) - Italian-American food done well. His giant 14" pan is great.
- [Chefs Labo](https://youtube.com/c/CHEFSLABO) - Japanese,  great rationale explanations. Good yoshoku and washoku.
- [My Name is Andong](https://youtube.com/c/mynameisandong) - German/Asian Fusion. Sometimes Russian food. Great ideas and historical bent to the channel.
- [Internet Shaquille](https://youtube.com/c/internetshaquille) - NetShaq is great. No-nonsense and info-packed.
- [Pati Jinich](https://youtube.com/user/patriciajinich) - More great Mexican food.
- [Adam Liaw](https://youtube.com/user/adamliaw) - More great East Asian cuisine.
- [Hanbit Cho](https://youtube.com/c/HanbitCho) - Excellent baking channel. Korean, but he trained in the UK. All around great recipes and explanations.
- [Kunal Kapoor](https://youtube.com/c/KunalKapur) - Great Indian channel.
- [Way of Ramen](https://youtube.com/c/WayofRamen) - Obviously it's Turkish food. Or maybe it's a ramen channel.
- [Spice 'n Pans](https://youtube.com/c/SpiceNPans) - More good Chinese cuisine.
- [Yakitori Guy](https://youtube.com/c/Yakitoriguy) - All yakitori all the time.
- [Protocooks with Chef Frank](https://youtube.com/c/ProtoCookswithChefFrank) - Culinary instructor with grest explanations.
- [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/) - Another great Japanese food resource.
- [Alex French Guy Cooking](https://youtube.com/c/FrenchGuyCooking) - Likes to do extraordinary deep dives into specific topics, like meatballs. The pathos is a little over the top sometimes.
- [Ethan Chlebowski](https://youtube.com/c/CookwithE) - Good content for the most part. His episode on hoagies/grinders is probably my favorite of his contributions.
- [Adam Ragusea](https://youtube.com/user/aragusea) - Journalist turned food YouTuber. Often makes some excellent points and delivers on the food.
- [Bruno Albouze](https://youtube.com/c/BrunoAlbouze) - German/French chef, very classical.
- [Chef Chu's Kitchen](https://youtube.com/c/ChefChusKitchen) - Lots of good Chinese baking (HK style)
- [Rajshri Food](https://youtube.com/c/rajshrifood) - another good Indian channel

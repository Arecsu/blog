Ask yourself: "Is it worth it?"


There will be times where something is easy to do. Maybe even effortless. The opportunity might come to you almost by itself. But if it's not worth it, it's wise to say no and avoid it.

There will be times where something is hard to do. Maybe even painful. The opportunity might not come to you at all and you have to invest a lot of energy and time to even get a chance. But if it's worth it, you should do it.

It doesn't matter how easy or hard it is to do something. What ultimately matters is whether it's worth it or not.

We may find ourselves saying yes to a once-in-a-lifetime paycheck in exchange for a _particular set of dirty but simple practices_ in our job. 

Easy, right? Is it worth it? Can you forsee the consequences of your actions?

Sometimes, we may find ourselves saying no to .......

For some reason, we tend to place great value on things based on how difficult they are to get. 

The greater the effort, the greater the value. Right? That's a mistake.

After grinding our way towards something very difficult, we don't know why we are unable to enjoy the fruits of our labor, Sometimes, we end up questioning why is that we wanted it in the first place.

It's not about the difficulty. It's about the worth. How easy or hard something is to get is – mostly – irrelevant.

Culturally we place _ethereal value_ on things that are hard to get. We love the idea of being the main protagonist of the [hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey).

Movies, music, social media, the stories we tell ourselves. They all point to that idea. 

Sometimes we do it to show off. The truth is: no one cares. Or maybe they do care a little bit, but really is it worth the insane levels of effort to just cather to other people's expectations?

Sometimes we do it because we really think the only good things in life are the difficult ones. Again, have you ever --------

I've been guilty of this. I don't see it that way anymore. And you shouldn't either.

Life is much lighter that way.
